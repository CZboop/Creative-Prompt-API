# Creative Prompt API  

A Spring Boot Rest API and accompanying React.js front end website which gives the user creative prompts across several disciplines.

Can create, read, update and delete through the API endpoints. 
The front end site provides a basic read-only interface for users to get a single prompt at a time either completely at random or with some filters applied.
